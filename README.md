# ShareSpace

### Description

ShareSpace is an online web repository that allows students to share academic material within their educational communities. Sharing academic information in order to help and assist other classmates is considered a charitable movement and is proposed to enhance, improve and strengthen the academic performance of all students. Students that wish to create and share academic material are often found with profound intentions of doing good in a classroom. At the same time, students want to practice and learn from material that falls beyond the classroom. However, they are unable to find the correct platform that provides a space for effective, productive and successful pedagogical sharing. As a social sharing service, ShareSpace brings together the *supply* of academic material and *demand* of students wanting to learn the **equilibrium** of improving student skills, capabilities and potentials.
